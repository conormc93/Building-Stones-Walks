  <h3>Location No. 3: The Claddagh Church</h3>
  <p>Saint Mary’s on the Hill, Dominican Church, commonly known as the Claddagh Church was opened on October 25th 1891 and is largely constructed of locally quarried pink Galway granite - indeed it is the best example of a granite building in the city, together with Galway grey limestone blocks.</p>

  <p>Pillars of locally polished Galway granite adorn the interior.  Two types of feldspar are visible.  The potassium rich salmon pink orthoclase feldspar (up to ~3cm long), and the milky white sodium rich plagioclase feldspar.  The dark flecks visible are iron rich mica called biotite - the grey glassy grains are quartz.  The Dominican House Chronicle (1921-1962) includes a document describing the Claddagh Church as being 'on the verge of the Atlantic, in glistening Galway granite’.</p>
