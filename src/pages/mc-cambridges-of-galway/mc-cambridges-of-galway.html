    <h3>Location No. 7: McCambridge’s Shop</h3>
    <p>McCambridge’s polished fascia is of larvikite panels and is one of several buildings on this walk to use this interesting building stone. It is an igneous rock which is quarried at Larvik in southern Norway.  It is described as a brilliant blue or green rock whose constituent feldspar crystals catch the weakest sunlight and shimmer, producing a colourful iridescent effect called schillerisation.  This schiller effect has led to the immense popularity of this stone in cities throughout the world.  Both green and blue varieties, otherwise known in the stone trade as Emerald Pearl and Blue Pearl (or Viking Blue), are used in the city.</p>
    <p>The variety used here is Emerald Pearl. Another popular construction use for this stone is as an armourstone which means it is used in the construction of harbours and the protection of vulnerable sections of coastline.  The Mutton Island sewage plant has used larvikite as an armourstone for protection from Atlantic storms.</p>
