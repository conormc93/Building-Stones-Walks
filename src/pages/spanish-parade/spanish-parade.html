  <h3>Location No. 4: The Spanish Arch</h3>
  <p>The Spanish Arch was built in 1584.  The 1651 city map shows a rectangular fort, Ceann na Bhalla, surmounting four arches.  However all that remains today is the “Blind Arch”, more usually known as the Spanish Arch.  The arch itself is constructed of limestone, but also contains amphibolite.  The remains of the old city wall that still stands in this area contain rounded blocks of granite and limestone.  Behind the Arch, Nimmo’s Restaurant, named after the Scottish engineer who built most of Galway’s 19th century piers, is constructed of similar stone.  The old city museum building, next door, has two limestone pillars on each side of its main door, and a limestone archway over a second, Georgian–style doorway.  The new City Museum is located close to the former and uses limestone and granite cladding and paving.  The seats outside are topped with granite.  Most of the surrounding buildings in this area were constructed in 19th century of local limestone blocks. The area around the Spanish Arch in known as Spanish Parade and the adjoining streets preserve much of Galway’s medieval character.  The piazza area uses Castle Stone in a mosaic pattern and it is matched with Kilkenny limestone for borders, seating, mooring posts and tree surrounds.</p>
  <p>Opposite the Spanish Arch stand the remains of Blake’s Castle, probably built in the early 16th century, which passed through the hands of the families of O’Halloran, Blake and Morgan of Monksfield.  It was at different times both a jailhouse and a corn store.  Today, only the south wall remains intact, as well as a fraction of the east and west walls.  Constructed of local limestone, two examples of cusped trefoil-type windows can be seen in the upper section of the east wall.  It has recently been restored and incorporated into Jury’s Inn (and Costa Coffee), which use exterior limestone cladding.</p>
