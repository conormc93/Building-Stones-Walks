    <h3>Location No. 8: Lynch's Castle</h3>
    <p>Lynch’s Castle, the home of Allied Irish Bank, is the only complete secular medieval building in Galway.  It was constructed of local Angliham or Menlough limestone in the late 15th to early 16th century.  On the castle’s Shop St. front there is a rectangular panel showing the coat of arms of King Henry VIII, and a stone roundel containing the coat of arms of the Lynch family. </p>
    <p>On the castle’s Abbeygate St. front the coat of arms of the Earl of Kildare is visible. In the foyer of the building, there is a 17th century limestone fireplace. Underfoot, are flagstones made of Merlin Black Limestone which was quarried at Merlin Park. Fossils of corals and brachiopods composed of white calcite contrast with black colour of the host limestone. An interesting feature of the exterior is the sixteen carved limestone gargoyles (water spouts) that can be seen under the parapets.</p>
