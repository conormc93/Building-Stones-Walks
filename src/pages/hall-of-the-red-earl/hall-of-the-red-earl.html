  <h3>Location No. 5: The Hall of the Red Earl</h3>
  <p> On Druid Lane, is the Hall of the Red Earl, the most important archaeological site in
      Galway City.  It is intimately associated with the establishment of the town of Galway 
      in the 13th century by the Anglo-Norman de Burgo family. The red haired Richard de Burgo 
      who built the hall was granted the title Earl of Ulster and the building became known as 
      the “Hall of the Red Earl”.  The hall became a key municipal building and was used to 
      collect taxes, dispense justice and to host banquets.</p>
      <p>In the late 15th century the de Burgos were forced out of the city and the hall fell into ruin and over the centuries was covered over and built upon.  The building was unearthed by Office of Public Works (OPW) archaeologists in 1997.  The discovery of the Red Earl’s Hall led to the proposed extension to the Revenue Commissioners offices being completely redesigned to allow for the preservation of the archaeological site.  Realising the immense importance of the hall, the offices were instead constructed by the OPW in bridge-like fashion overhead.  Added to this, the hall was housed within glass panelling and a viewing gangway complete with flood-lighting was erected around it.  Interpretive panels now explain the significance of the site and artefact replicas are prominently displayed.  Since late 2009 Dúchas na Gaillimhe – Galway Civic Trust has welcomed thousand of visitors to The Hall of Red Earl.  This hugely important site stands as testament to the medieval origins our modern, vibrant city and is a must-see site for anyone wishing to learn about the story of Galway.  The rubble walls of the hall were constructed of local metamorphic rock and limestone-rare Galway Granite blocks are also present.  The base of the load bearing columns is preserved and was constructed of cut blocks of local limestone.  One of these clearly was erected on a bedrock of metamorphic rock called amphibolite.  Thin ~2cm wide veins of light pink granite (Galway Granite) cut through the bedrock.</p>
