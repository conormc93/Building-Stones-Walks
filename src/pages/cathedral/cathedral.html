  <h3>Location No. 2: The Cathedral of Our Lady Assumed into Heaven and St. Nicholas</h3>
  <p>The Cathedral of Our Lady Assumed into Heaven and St. Nicholas dates from 1965. Dr. Michael Browne, the then bishop of Galway, authorised the construction of the present cathedral.  The Cathedral was designed by J.J. Robinson of Robinson, Keefe and Devane and was built on the site of the former jail.  It is an outstanding example of an Irish mid-20th century building totally constructed of natural stone.  It offers classic examples of the use of natural stone as a load bearing and as an ornamental material.  Local and imported stone adorn every functional element of the Cathedral's interior space from the Connemara marble floor tiles to the white Italian Carrara marble high altar.  At the entrance to the Cathedral there are gate pillars of Ballinasloe limestone blocks, capped with domes of worked Ballinasloe limestone.  These domes contain an abundance of fossil fragments.  These fossils are the entombed remains of shellfish such as crinoid and brachiopods that lived some 350 million years ago in a shallow subtropical sea located south of the equator.  Outside the building the surrounding area is paved with flagstones, from Liscannor, County Clare, with their distinctive worm or mollusc burrows, known as Olivellites.

  <p>The Cathedral itself is constructed of cut blocks of limestone sourced from Angliham quarries.  These limestone blocks produce a light and dark grey patchwork visible on both the walls and interior arches and pillars.  Connemara marble (from Streamstown quarry near Clifden) tiles matched with polished red sandstone insets, known as  “Cork Red Marble” adorn the floor.  The characteristic multilayered nature of the Connemara marble displays intricate folded patterns, produced by the earth’s crustal movements, some 470 million years ago.  The rails in front of the High Altar are constructed from white Carrara marble while the Altar is constructed of a dark serpentinite and marble support on which rests a single slab (5'x10'x0.5') of white Carrara marble. The floor surrounding the altar area is of Portuguese beige marble tiles with diamond shaped marble insets.  In the Baptistry, the font is of polished limestone while the walls are panelled with Portuguese marble quarried at Estrimoz, 125 km west of Lisbon.  Note how the marble panels are matched to form kaleidoscope-like patterns using the natural layering in the stone.  This cutting and polishing process is known as quartering and is a testament to the skills of the marble workers involved in the construction.  The entire Cathedral offers one of the finest examples of the use of natural stone in Ireland - those interested in reading more should read a 32-page publication by the Administrators of Galway Cathedral entitled Cathedral of Our Lady Assumed into Heaven and St. Nicholas Galway, published in 1980 by Shanway Publications Ltd., Glengormley, N. Ireland.

  <p>It is now a pleasant 10-15 stroll along the bank of the River Corrib to location No.3.
