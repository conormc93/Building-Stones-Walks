<h3>Location No. 1: National University of Ireland, Galway Quadrangle</h3>
<p>
  The University was founded in 1845, one of the three Queen’s Colleges founded in that year, in Ireland.  Joseph B. Keane designed the Quadrangle Building (loc. 1), its main tower is a replica of Christopher Wren's Tom Tower in Christ Church College, Oxford.  It was constructed in 1848 of cut blocks of fossiliferous limestone, from the Angliham quarries at a cost of £38,000. Fossilised remains of coral and brachiopod occur with abundance in the cut blocks.  The Quadrangle Building is decorated with mullioned windows and a crenulated parapet flanked by octagonal turrets.  On close examination some limestone blocks exhibit thin milky white crusts of carbonate that tend to drape over the blocks.  This results from the precipitation of carbonate (calcium carbonate CaCO3 called calcite) from water containing dissolved calcium carbonate from the limestone.  Evaporation and precipitation occurs when the aqueous solution flows over the block.  Rare purple fluorite (mineral containing calcium and fluorine) crystals can be seen in some blocks within the Quadrangle. Granite flagstone pathways have recently replaced the Quadrangle’s tarmacadam footpaths.  The flagstones were imported from Portugal.  This project was undertaken as part of the University’s celebrations in 1999 of 150 years since its first Graduation Ceremony.  The archway is floored with concrete cobblestones, known in the building trade as Castle Stone.

  Use this opportunity to visit The James Mitchell Museum, which is situated in the Quadrangle and contains an impressive collection of rocks, minerals and fossils from all over the world, about 12,000 specimens in all. The Museum is open to the public and extends a warm welcome to visitors. Noteworthy, is the William King (first Professor of Geology) Collection of Permian (290-250 mya) fossils, which include many type specimens of great scientific importance.  The Adrian Ryder gemstone collection is an eye-catching array of precious and semi-precious stones collected from all over the world and donated by Adrian Ryder in 2013.  Other collections include the mineral and rock collections from the West of Ireland.  The Museum was formally designated the James Mitchell Museum in 1977 in recognition of the considerable contributions made by James Mitchell (Prof. of Geology & Mineralogy 1921-1966 and College Secretary & Registrar 1934-1966) to the development of the University. 
  At the University Road entrance to the south campus stands the Gate-Lodge, constructed of dressed blocks of limestone and dark grey blocks of amphibolite and granite gneiss.  The roof is constructed of slate from Bangor in Wales.  Portuguese granite slabs identical to those in the Quadrangle, are used in the pathways surrounding the lodge.
