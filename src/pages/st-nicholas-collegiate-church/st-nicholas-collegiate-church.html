  <h3>Location No. 6: St Nicholas’ Collegiate Church</h3>
  <p>St. Nicholas’ Collegiate Church was built from local limestone in 1320 and subsequently enlarged in the 15th and 16th centuries.  It is one of the best preserved medieval churches in Ireland and is the oldest surviving building in the city.  Inside local limestone was used for the pillars and fonts.  The floors and surrounding areas are paved with flagstones, from Liscannor, County Clare, with their distinctive worm or mollusc burrows, known as Olivellites.</p>
  <p>For those interested in more information regarding this majestic building there is a book – The Story of St. Nicholas’ Collegiate Church, Galway, by Rev. J. Fleetwood (1912) and recently revised by Jim Higgins, Rev., Canon Leslie D. A. Forrest and Derek Biddulph (1989).  The obelisk in front of the Church is made from Galway granite and limestone.  The obelisk was erected in 1887 and commemorates the tragic death of three young men - John Shelton Thompson, Francis John Langley Kinkead and Thomas Leopold Roberts.  They were drowned on the 17th August 1887 while sailing to Oughterard on a wind swept Lough Corrib.  The limestone carving on the front of the obelisk is the Claddagh ring emblem - joined hands supporting a crowned heart - a symbol of love, friendship and loyalty.  The right side has the skull and crossbones with the words "Memento mori", on the left side is an Irish harp and on the back are the arms of Galway.</p>
